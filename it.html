							<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b></p>
							<p>Growing up on a farm you would think that most of my interests would be somehow related to the land or country, however my interest in computers and technology was fostered from a young age by my father buying my brother and I, many games and helping us build our first computer to play half-life. This interest carried on leading to me building my own computer when I was 14. I enjoy using computers and seeing technology advance in ways that were unimaginable in the past. </p>
							<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b></p>
							<p>My interest in IT started from a very early age but I would say I didn’t really get involved until I built my first computer. After I had my own computer I had free reign on a system all of my own, I could do anything I want, however being me, I spent most of this time playing videogames. My first introduction to coding was when me and a couple of my friends started hosting game servers for games such as Garry’s Mod and Counter-Strike Source. The most fun part about running these servers was to add custom content that we created or found online to make the server unique and to get people to keep playing.</p>
							<p><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b></p>
							<p>The person that sparked my interest in IT was defiantly my father, like I have previously stated he was my introduction to video games, computers and the internet. When I was a young child we would go to technology swap meets in town where they would be selling computer parts, video games and other things related to technology, and this is where we would do most of out shopping for computer related things at the time. We had dial up internet at the time to downloading games or shows at the time was quite difficult.</p>
							<p><b>Outline your IT experience</b></p>
							<p>I don’t really have any professional IT experience before starting at RMIT, however I had spent many years doing it as a hobby. I have in the past made websites using templates and by coding myself for previous school work. Other IT endeavours include building myself and my friend’s computers, running servers for games with my friends and managing a web forum for said servers.</p>
							<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
							<p>I chose to come to RMIT because of the great reputation that the university has, the easily accessible location in the city, the resources provided by the University and all the great things I have heard from my friends that have attended here. Now that I have started attending RMIT I do not regret my choice as the Uni has surpassed my expectations.</p>
							<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
							<p>During my time studying at RMIT I expect to learn how to code in multiple languages, increase my knowledge of design and UX, learn about networking and all other parts involved in IT. Right know I am unsure of what I want to focus on and pursue as a career, but I am very interested in learning about things related to gaming, AI, VR and cyber security.</p>
