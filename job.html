							<p><b>My Ideal Job</b></p>
							<p>My ideal job would be working as a programmer and I have found a job on seek that I think would suit me quite well.</p>
							<p><b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/36859322?type=standout">Link to job advertisement on SEEK</a></b></p>
							<p>This job is for a JavaScript developer for a large bank and would have me working in an intense high stakes environment and require me to be constantly learning on and off the job. However, this job has some very large requirements for applicants to be considered. You must have four years experience developing consumer website, two years experience developing Single Page Applications, a year of experience developing using React.js or Angular.js, knowledge of front end build tools and package managers, extensive Responsive Web Design experience and a passion for web development. I’m not afraid to say it, but I don’t have any of those skills besides a “passion for web development” so I’m defiantly not going to be able to walk into a job like this fresh out of University</p>
							<p>At this point in time I only have very rudimentary programming and design knowledge, but I am keen to learn and expand on my skills in my studies. To obtain the skills necessary to land this job I will have to be not only trying my best to improve myself at Uni, I should also be programming and researching at home. I will also have to be working other jobs outside of Uni before being able to work there.</p>
