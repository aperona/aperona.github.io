							<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
							<p>After completing these personality tests, I see that I am an introverted person who actively tries to mend divides and help people see things from other perspectives, so I think I would be a great support role in a team. Finding out that I am a visual learner was quite eye opening due to the fact that when I remember directions I quite often can clearly picture the place and how to get there but can’t necessarily remember street or building names, this means that I should sit at the front of lectures to be able to fully comprehend what I am learning.</p>
							<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
							<p>I think that these results have made it much clearer to me what my strengths and weaknesses are when working in a team and I think that this will help me in finding my position in a team. However, ultimately, I don’t think it will have too much of an effect on how I work in a team, but I will try to remember what I learned in this tests to apply it to my teamwork! </p>
							<p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b></p>
							<p>When forming a team, I should try and find personalities that do not clash with my own and people that share similar thoughts and attitudes to my own to make the process easier. If I were to get in a group with someone who takes the project all over themselves and doesn’t consider any of the other team members in the decision making I would find it quite difficult to work with them and quite difficult to produce a satisfactory product.</p>
